# Users

## Create a User

Creating a new user account can be done using the <a href="/dashboard/account">Account Page</a> under the `Users` section.

In this section you need to enter the Users email address, this is the email address the invite link will be sent to.

> **Note**: If you are using Hosted SSM Cloud it will show the invite link in the success message.

When creating a user you can assign a [User Role](#user-roles) this will add permissions to the user.

## User Roles

User roles are groups of permissions that a user can do with-in the UI.

By default we create three common user roles:

-   Administrator
-   Super User
-   User
